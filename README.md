# ObjectiveC
Objective-C examples tested on OS X10.10
<li>Some basic tutorial examples are adjusted to be run in OS X10.10.
 The codes are modified for Mac OS X from the original execises of
 <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-objective-c">the free course of Code School</a>
 Part of examples are from <a href="http://gnustep.made-it.com/BG-objc/">Beginners Guide to Objective-C Programming</a>.
 They do not require Foundation include and can be run under Linux too.
<li>These can be run without XCode in the bash console. However, you need gcc compiler which is included 
within Xcode Command Line Tools. Mac Objective-C requires include &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
 which is not available if run under Linux.
<li>Compile each example just by running make on the commandline of you console.</li>
